\title{Smoothness Constraints Matrix for Bivariate Spline over Triangular Partition}
\usage{
smoothness2D(V, Tr, d, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{A matrix of vertices (\code{nV} x 2), where \code{nV} is the number of vertices. Each row represents the coordinates of a vertex in 2D space.}

\item{Tr}{A matrix of triangular partitions (\code{nT} x 3), where \code{nT} is the number of triangles. Each row contains indices of vertices in \code{V}.}

\item{d}{The degree of piecewise polynomials. Must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.}

\item{r}{The smoothness parameter. Must be an integer where \code{0 <= r < d}.}
}
\value{
A sparse matrix representing the smoothness constraints.
}
\description{
Computes the smoothness constraints matrix for bivariate splines defined over a triangular partition.
}
\details{
This function computes the smoothness constraints for bivariate splines over a triangular partition using barycentric coordinates. It ensures that adjacent triangles satisfy the required smoothness conditions based on the given degree (\code{d}) and smoothness parameter (\code{r}).

The sparse matrix returned represents the constraints that enforce continuity across the shared edges of adjacent triangles.

This implementation is adapted from the MATLAB code by Ming-Jun Lai from the University of Georgia.
