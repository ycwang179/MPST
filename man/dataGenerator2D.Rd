\title{Generate Testing Dataset for Bivariate Spline Smoothing}
\usage{
dataGenerator2D(Z, V, Tr, func = 1, sigma = 0.1, seed = 2024)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{A matrix of dimension \code{n} by two, where \code{n} is the number of points. Each row represents the 2D coordinates of a point.}

\item{V}{A matrix of dimension \code{nV} by two, where \code{nV} is the number of vertices in the triangulation. Each row represents the 2D coordinates of a vertex.}

\item{Tr}{A matrix of dimension \code{nT} by three, where \code{nT} is the number of triangles in the triangulation. Each row contains the indices of three vertices in \code{V} that form a triangle.}

\item{func}{An integer specifying the function used to calculate the mean values (\code{mu}) at the 2D points. Supported values range from \code{1} to \code{15}, with different mathematical forms for each choice. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{sigma}{The standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to the response variable. Default is \code{0.1}.}

\item{seed}{A seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility. Default is \code{2024}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
  \item{Y}{A vector of generated response values, including noise.}
  \item{mu}{A vector of true mean values (\code{mu}) at the 2D points.}
  \item{Z}{The input matrix of 2D coordinates.}
  \item{ind.inside}{A binary vector indicating whether each point is inside (\code{1}) or outside (\code{0}) the triangulation.}
  \item{ind.T}{A vector containing the indices of the triangle each point belongs to (if inside).}
}
\description{
This function generates testing datasets for bivariate spline smoothing based on specified test functions and input coordinates.
}
\details{
This R program is based on methods described in Lai and Wang (2013). It supports up to 15 test functions, each providing different mathematical forms for the mean function (\code{mu}).
