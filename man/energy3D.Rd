\title{Energy Function for Trivariate Spline over Tetrahedral Partition}
\usage{
energy3D(V, Tr, d)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{A numeric matrix of dimension \code{N x 3}, where \code{N} is the number of vertices. Each row represents the 3D coordinates of a vertex.}

\item{Tr}{A numeric matrix of dimension \code{nT x 4}, where \code{nT} is the number of tetrahedrons in the partition. Each row contains the indices of the four vertices in \code{V} that form a tetrahedron.}

\item{d}{An integer specifying the degree of piecewise polynomials (default: \code{9}). It determines the complexity of the spline basis functions. Must be greater than 1.}
}
\value{
The energy matrix.
}
\description{
Computes the energy matrix for a trivariate spline defined over a tetrahedral partition.
}
\details{
This R program is modified based on the Matlab program written by Ming-Jun Lai from the University of Georgia.
