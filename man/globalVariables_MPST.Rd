\title{Suppress NOTES for Undefined Global Variables}
\description{
Certain global variables are used internally in functions such as \code{plot.slice.mpst}
for interactive visualization. These variables are dynamically created during execution
(e.g., using \code{manipulate::slider}), and therefore static code analysis tools
may flag them as undefined. This declaration informs R's static analysis tools
(e.g., \code{R CMD check}) that these variables are intentional and should not
generate NOTES during package checking.
}
\note{
This declaration suppresses warnings for the following global variables:
\itemize{
  \item \code{axial_slice}
  \item \code{coronal_slice}
  \item \code{sagittal_slice}
  \item \code{color}
}
}
